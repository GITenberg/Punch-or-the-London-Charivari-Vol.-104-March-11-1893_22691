<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<p class="center">No. VI.&mdash;REGISTRATION REFORM.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Scene and Persons as Usual.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Well-Informed Man</i> (<i>bristling with indignation, as he lays
down his newspaper</i>). Well, I'm dashed!</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>nervously</i>). What's up?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> <i>What's up!</i> Everything's up. Up the spout,
that's where this blessed country will be if this kind of thing's
going on.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What kind of thing?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why, all this gerrymandering kind of business.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh, by the way, that reminds me. I came on that word
the other day. Can any of you chaps tell me what it means?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's as plain as
a pikestaff. It means playing
ducks and drakes with things all
round, and letting the whole
business go thoroughly rotten.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Has it got anything
to do with jerry-builders?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's the same
thing precisely.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>insisting</i>). But what's
the point of calling 'em jerry?
Where does that come in?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's a French
word.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> It isn't.
It's German.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Bosh, it's French.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> I bet you a
dollar it's German.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> And I bet you
a dollar it's French. (<i>To Average
Man.</i>) Here, you decide. Which
is it?</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Well, I'm sure
it isn't French&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>).
Of course it isn't. Pay up, my boy!</p>

<p><i>Average Man</i> (<i>continuing</i>). But,
on the other hand, it isn't German.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, rot! It
must be one or the other, you
know. (<i>Scornfully.</i>) You'll be
telling us it's Greek next.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Well, of course,
it <i>might</i> be; but, as a matter of
fact, I fancy it's English.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i>, <i>Second W. I. M.</i>
(<i>together</i>). Oh, you tell that to the
Marines! It won't wash here.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). Perhaps
it's American.</p>

<p><i>Average Man</i> (<i>resignedly</i>).
Well I daresay it is. Any way,
you can have it so if you like,
It may be Sanskrit for all I care.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Retires to his paper. A pause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>to First W. I. M.</i>).
But, look here, what made you lose
your hair, just now? You looked
as angry as blazes about something.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>).
Did I? Well, isn't it enough to
make anybody, who loves his country,
angry when he sees what's
going on. Why, the Government's going to turn everything inside
out, with some blessed new law about elections. Registration Bill,
they call it, or something of that sort. Just as if we hadn't had
enough tinkering and pottering lately. It's all through this confounded
County Council interfering with everything.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>aggressive</i>). What the dickens has the County
Council got to do with it? You're always dropping on the County
Council.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, they've got their finger in every pie. I'm
pretty certain this is their job.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Well, you're wrong this time, that's all.
You're thinking of the Employers' Liability Bill.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, I'm not. I never even heard of it. So that's
where <i>you're</i> wrong. What has the Employers' Liabill got&mdash;&mdash;I
mean the Employers' (<i>steadily, and with determination</i>) Li-a-bil-ity
Bill got to do with the County Council?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Everything. Didn't you read <span class="sc">John Burns's</span>
speech about it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No&mdash;and I don't mean to. Ask me another.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> All right&mdash;I will. Do you mean to deny that
our present Registration System is a ridiculous one?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>hotly</i>). Yes, I do.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>with triumph</i>). Ah, I've got you now. You
said, only yesterday, that any system by which a Government like
this got into power must be ridiculous. (<i>To</i> Inquirer.) Didn't he?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well, I'm not quite sure. I rather fancy he
did say something of that kind. But&mdash;(<i>deprecatingly</i>)&mdash;perhaps he meant something else.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, I didn't. I meant what I said&mdash;and I stick
to it. But that isn't the same thing as the Registration System.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Perhaps you'll tell us, then, what the Registration
System is?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes, do. I
should like to get to the bottom of
it, because I'm constantly meeting
a sort of third cousin of mine,
who's a Registrar of something or
other, and I never quite know
what he does. All I know is, that
he isn't a Registrar in Bankruptcy.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Let me see&mdash;how
can I put it shortly? It's
just this&mdash;you chaps have got votes.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>decisively</i>). No, I
haven't.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>put out</i>). Ah,
but you ought to have.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>cutting in</i>).
There you are again. That's just
what I've been saying all along.
He ought to have&mdash;but he hasn't;
so where's your beautiful system
now?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>retreating strategically</i>).
I never said it was <i>perfect</i>,
did I? But I'll come to that
afterwards. (<i>To</i> Inquirer.) Now
why haven't you got a vote?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>with a painful sense
of inferiority</i>). I'm sure I don't
know. I suppose the old Johnny,
whoever he is, didn't chalk me
down when he went round last
time.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Probably you
haven't lived in your house long
enough. You haven't got a
qualifying period.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Haven't I? How long
ought I to have lived there?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). Oh,
it's something between three and
four years. I can't tell you the
exact number; they alter it every
year.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Who alter it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> The Revising
Barristers, or somebody.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Well, my
brother-in-law's a Revising Barrister,
and I never heard of him
doing that.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>sarcastic</i>). But
you don't suppose he'd tell <i>you</i>
everything he does, do you?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But I've lived in my house six years.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah! but aren't you a lodger?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> What's the odds if he is? My brother's a
lodger, and I know he's got a vote.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> But that's a different franchise altogether.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> How do you mean? They're both lodgers.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> But they don't live in the same district. Perhaps
they don't give him a latch-key.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>producing it</i>). Yes they do. Here it is. (<i>Chuckles</i>.) I think
I jolly well see myself without a latch-key. But, I say, about this vote.
I don't half like not having got one. What shall I do about it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> You'd better see somebody about it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Somebody was talking about Leasehold Franchise the
other day. Perhaps I could get in on that.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah! I daresay that <i>might</i> help you. [<i>Terminus.</i></p>

<p><i>Time and the Woman.</i> By <span class="sc">Richard Pryce</span>. Not by any means
a pearl of Pryce, and certainly not likely to make so great noise in
the novel-reading world as did <i>The Quiet Mrs. Fleming</i>, by the
same author. <span class="sc">Methuen &amp; Co</span>. publish it.</p>

<p>The Baron heartily recommends <span class="sc">Frank Barrett's</span> novel, in three
vols., entitled, <i>Kitty's Father</i>. A thoroughly absorbing plot, well
worked out, and interesting right up to the last page. <i>Kitty's</i> father
is a mysterious person, and she, not being a wise child, for she doesn't
know him, does several foolish things, and says several wise ones.
<i>Kitty's</i> uncle is a necessary nuisance, but a cleverly and consistently
drawn character,
while <i>Kitty</i> herself is delightfully
made out of good
home-spun material. But
the villanous Curate is
just a bit too grotesque,
too Uriah-Heepish for the
awfully tragic situation in
which he is placed. When
the imaginative author
shifts the scene to Dublin,
why did he not represent
an Irish Cardinal-Archbishop
as waiting at the
stage-door to escort home
the light-and-leading lady?
But "for a' that and a'
that," most decidedly
"read it," quoth the
Baron, and on he goes
again.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marion Crauford's</span>
<i>Children of the King</i>, published
by <span class="sc">Macmillan</span>, is
a tragic story, told in
most simple and most
fascinating style. It is all
colour and character: the
colours and the characters
being those of Southern
Italy.</p>

<p>Out of regard to the
importunities of numerous
correspondents, the Baron
has read <span class="sc">Ibsen's</span> <i>Master
Builder</i>, translated by two
of the Ibsenitish cult.
"Only fancy!" Of all
the weak-knee'd, wandering,
effeminate, unwholesome,
immoral, dashed
"rot," to quote <i>Lord Arthur</i>
in the <i>Pantomime
Rehearsal</i>, this is the
weak-knee'dest, effeminatest,
and all the epithets
as above superlatived.
Read it by all means, and
see it, too, if you will, but
if the honest English play-goer's
verdict is worth a
"big, big, D" (I thank
thee, W. S. G., for teaching
me that abbreviated form
of dashed expressiveness!)
he will give <span class="sc">Ibsen's</span> <i>Master
Builder</i> the benefit of the
"D," and "D" it once and for ever. And that, at your service,
my masters, is the rough-and-ready opinion expressed by,</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,    <span class="sc">The Baron de B.-W.</span></p>

<p>The benefits that Sir <span class="sc">John Lawes</span> has been able and will yet be
able to confer on agriculturists everywhere, including those in his
immediate neighbourhood, cause him to be regarded as a living

The chief speakers were Mr. <span class="sc">Parrot</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Onions</span>. Mr. G.
observed that in all his vast
experience, frequently as
he had tasted a savoury
dish of rabbit and onions,
yet the combination of
Parrot with Onions was
something really novel.
Perhaps Mr. <span class="sc">Parrot</span> would
be useful at any bye-election,
and would give them
the state of the poll. As
to Mr. <span class="sc">Onions</span>, well, he
(Mr. G.) hadn't words of
welcome sufficiently strong
for him. Why hadn't he
brought "<span class="sc">Brer Rabbit</span>"
with him? In approaching
the Eight Hours' Question,
no time must be lost, so he
would at once proceed to
business.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Haustus Herdal</i> (<i>enters through hall-door;

(<i>Hangs up hat, and throws his mackintosh

bills yet?      [<i>Looks sternly at her.</i></p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>in a low hesitating voice</i>). Almost.
I have charged each patient with three attendances
daily. Even when you only dropped
in for a cup of tea and a chat. (<i>Passionately.</i>)
I felt I <i>must</i>&mdash;I <i>must</i>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>alters his tone, clasps her head
in his hands, and whispers</i>). I wish you could
make out the bills for me, <i>always</i>.</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>in nervous exaltation</i>). How lovely
that would be! Oh, you are so unspeakably
good to me! It is too enthralling to be here!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Sinks down and embraces his knees.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> So I've understood. (<i>With
suppressed irritation.</i>) For goodness' sake,
let go my legs! I do <i>wish</i> you wouldn't be
so confoundedly neurotic!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>has risen, and comes in through
glass-door, breathing with difficulty; he is a
prematurely bald young man of fifty-five,
with a harelip and squints slightly</i>). I beg
pardon, Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>, I see I interrupt you.
(<i>As</i> <span class="sc">Senna</span> <i>rises</i>.) I have just completed
this pill. Have you looked at it?</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He offers it for inspection
diffidently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>evasively</i>).
It appears to be a pill of
the usual dimensions.</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>cast down</i>).
All these years you have
never given me one encouraging
word! <i>Can't</i>
you praise my pill?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>struggles
with himself</i>). I&mdash;I
cannot. You should
not attempt to compound
pills on your
own account.</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>breathing laboriously</i>).
And yet
there was a time when
<i>you</i>, too&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>complacently</i>).
Yes, it was certainly a pill that came as a lucky stepping-stone&mdash;but
not a pill like that!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>vehemently</i>). Listen! Is that your last word? <i>Is</i> my
aged mother to pass out of this world without ever knowing whether
I am competent to construct an effective pill or not?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>as if in desperation</i>). You had better try it upon your
mother&mdash;it will enable her to form an opinion. Only mind&mdash;I will
not be responsible for the result.</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> I understand. Exactly as you tried <i>your</i> pill, all those
years ago, upon Dr. <span class="sc">Ryval</span>.      [<i>He bows, and goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>uneasily</i>). He said that so strangely, <span class="sc">Senna</span>. But
tell me now&mdash;when are you going to marry him?</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>starts&mdash;half glancing up at him</i>). I&mdash;I don't know. This
year&mdash;next-year&mdash;now&mdash;<i>never</i>! I cannot marry him ... I cannot&mdash;I
<i>cannot</i>&mdash;it is so utterly impossible to leave you!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, I can understand <i>that</i>. But, my poor <span class="sc">Senna</span>,
hadn't you better take a little walk?</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>clasps her hands gratefully</i>). How sweet and thoughtful
you are to me! I <i>will</i> take a walk.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>with a suppressed smile</i>). Do! And&mdash;h'm!&mdash;you
needn't trouble to come back. I have advertised for a male book-keeper&mdash;they
are less emotional. Good-night, my little <span class="sc">Senna</span>!</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>softly, and quiveringly</i>). Good-night, Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Staggers out of the hall-door, blowing kisses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Herdal</i> (<i>enters through the window, plaintively</i>). Quite an
acquisition for you, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>, this Miss <span class="sc">Blakdraf</span>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> She's&mdash;h'm!&mdash;extremely civil and obliging. But I
am parting with her,
<span class="sc">Aline</span>&mdash;mainly on <i>your</i>
account.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> (<i>evades
him</i>). Was it on my
account, indeed, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>?
You have parted
with so many young
persons on my account&mdash;so
you tell me!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>depressed</i>).
Oh, but this is hopeless!
When I have tried so
hard to bring a ray of
sunlight into your
desolate life! I must
give <span class="sc">R&uuml;bub Kalomel</span>
notice too&mdash;his pill
is really too preposterous!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> (<i>feels
gropingly for a chair,
and sits down on the
floor</i>). Him, <i>too</i>! Ah,
<span class="sc">Haustus</span>, you will
never make my home
a real home for me.
My poor first husband,
<span class="sc">Halvard Solness</span>,
tried&mdash;and <i>he</i> couldn't!
When one has had such
misfortunes as I have&mdash;all
the family portraits
burnt, and the
silk dresses, too, and a
pair of twins, and nine
lovely dolls.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Chokes with tears.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>as if to
lead her away from the
subject</i>). Yes, yes, yes,
that must have been a
heavy blow for you, my
poor <span class="sc">Aline</span>. I can
understand that your
spirits can never be
really high again. And
then for poor Master
Builder <span class="sc">Solness</span> to be
so taken up with that
Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span> as he
was&mdash;that, too, was
so wretched for you.
To see him topple off
the tower, as he did
that day ten years
ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> Yes, that
too, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>. But I
did not mind it so much&mdash;it all seemed so perfectly natural in both
of them.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Natural! For a girl of twenty-three to taunt a
middle-aged architect, whom she knew to be constitutionally liable
to giddiness, never to let him have any peace till he had climbed a
spire as dizzy as himself&mdash;and all for the fun of seeing him fall off&mdash;how
in the world&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> (<i>laying the table for supper with dried fish and punch</i>).
The younger generation have a keener sense of humour than we
elder ones, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>, and perhaps, after all, she was only a perplexing
sort of allegory.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, that would explain her to some extent, no doubt.
But how <i>he</i> could be such an old fool!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span><p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> That Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span> was a strangely fascinating type
of girl. Why, even I myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>sits down and takes some fish</i>). Fascinating? Well,
goodness knows, I couldn't see <i>that</i> at all. (<i>Seriously.</i>) Has it never
struck you, <span class="sc">Aline</span>, that elderly Norwegians are so deucedly impressionable&mdash;mere
bundles of overstrained nerves, hypersensitive
ganglia. Except, of course, the Medical Profession.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> Yes, of course; those in that profession are not so
inclined to gangle. And when one has succeeded by such a stroke of
luck as you have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>drinks a glass of punch</i>). You're right enough there.
If I had not been called in to prescribe for Dr. <span class="sc">Ryval</span>, who used to
have the leading practice here, I should never have stepped so
wonderfully into his shoes as I did. (<i>Changes to a tone of quiet
chuckling merriment.</i>) Let me tell you a funny story, <span class="sc">Aline</span>; it
sounds a ludicrous thing&mdash;but all my good fortune here was based
upon a simple little pill. For if Dr. <span class="sc">Ryval</span> had never taken it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). Then you <i>do</i> think it was the pill that
caused him to&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> On the contrary; I am perfectly sure the pill had
nothing whatever to do with it&mdash;the inquest made it quite clear
that it was really the liniment. But don't you see, <span class="sc">Aline</span>, what
tortures me night and day is the thought that it <i>might</i> unconsciously
have been the pill which&mdash;&mdash;Never to be free from <i>that</i>! To have
such a thought gnawing and burning always&mdash;always, like a moral
mustard poultice! (<i>He takes more punch.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> Yes; I suppose there is a poultice of that sort burning
on every breast&mdash;and we must never take it off either&mdash;it is our
simple duty to keep it on. I too, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>, am haunted by a fancy
that if this Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span> were to ring at our bell now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> After she has been lost sight of for ten years? She is
safe enough in some Sanatorium, depend upon it. And what if she
<i>did</i> come? Do you think, my dear good woman, that I&mdash;a sensible
clear-headed general practitioner, who have found out all I know
for myself&mdash;would let her play the deuce with me as she did with
poor <span class="sc">Halvard</span>? No, general practitioners don't <i>do</i> such things&mdash;even
in Norway!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> Don't they indeed, <span class="sc">Haustus</span>? (<i>The Surgery-bell
rings loudly.</i>) Did you hear <i>that</i>? There she is! I will go and put
on my best cap. It is my duty to show her <i>that</i> small attention.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>laughing nervously</i>). Why, what on earth!&mdash;&mdash;It's the
night-bell. It is most probably the new book-keeper! (Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>
<i>goes out</i>; Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> <i>rises with difficulty, and opens the door</i>.)
Goodness gracious!&mdash;it <i>is</i> that girl, after all!</p>

<p><i>Hilda Wangel</i> (<i>enters through the Dispensary door. She wears

wing in it. Somewhat freckled. Carries a green tin cylinder slung

<i>her eyes sparkling with happiness</i>). How are you? I've run you
down, you see! The ten years are up. Isn't it scrumptiously
thrilling, to see me like this?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>politely retreating</i>). It is&mdash;very much so&mdash;but still
I don't in the least understand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>measures him with a glance</i>). Oh, you <i>will</i>. I have come
to be of use to you. I've no luggage, and no money. Not that
<i>that</i> makes any difference. I never <i>have</i>. And I've been allured

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> What the deuce! Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span>, you <i>mustn't</i>.  I'm

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> It does not seem to be of much <i>use</i> minding, Miss

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>in amused surprise</i>). Why, of course&mdash;what else should

<p><i>Judge.</i> Now I will swear the Jury.</p>

<p><i>Officer of the Court.</i> I beg your Lordship's pardon, but I have
always been accustomed to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Judge</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Not at all; I will do it myself. You can't
give <i>me</i> too much work. (<i>Swears the</i> Jury.) And now, Prisoner,
what do you plead, guilty or not guilty?</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> Well, my Lord, I should say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/113.png"><img width="100%" src="images/113.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Not guilty. Quite right, always give yourself the benefit
of the doubt. You can't imagine what stupid Jurymen we have
sometimes. Quite right to say Not guilty. And now who appears for
the prosecution?</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> I do, my Lord, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Glad to see the eminent counsel here, and I know of no
one who can better conduct a case. Still, with my learned friend's
or rather my learned brother's, I should say the learned Counsel's
permission, I will just open for the Crown myself. (<i>Opens for the
Crown with brilliant effect. Applause.</i>) No; I cannot allow any
demonstration of that sort. By the way (<i>to</i> Counsel for the Prosecution),
Have we any witnesses?</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> Yes, my Lord, a Police Sergeant.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Oh, indeed, I will soon settle him. (Witness <i>enters box
and is sworn</i>.) And now, you Sir, I am not going to allow any
speeches&mdash;so be on your guard. (<i>Examines and cross-examines him.</i>)
Have we any more witnesses?</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> No, my Lord&mdash;that is our case.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Quite so. The face of the learned Counsel, who is retained
for the defence, is new to me, but if he has no objection, I will
open for him.</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Thank you. (<i>Addresses the Jury.</i>) And now, if we have
no witnesses, I think I will sum up. (<i>To</i> Counsel for the Defence.)
Have we any witnesses?</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Well, I think we won't call any witnesses, because then
the Prosecution won't have a reply.</p>

<p><i>Counsel.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Quite so. And now, Gentlemen of the Jury, I have now
my own special functions to perform. I will sum up the case in my
judicial capacity. You must know then&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Sums up.</i>) And now
I will leave you to decide upon your verdict. (<i>Jury consults.</i>)
Or perhaps you would like to leave the matter to me?</p>

<p><i>Foreman of the Jury.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Thank you. Then I think we may say "Guilty."
Prisoner at the Bar, it is now my duty to sentence you. I think,
under all the circumstances of the case, that I need not treat you too
harshly. There is no doubt that the prosecution has been conducted
in a very able manner; and this remark is equally applicable to the
manner in which the defence has been carried out. I think a month's
imprisonment will be sufficient. Prisoner, you are sentenced to a
month's imprisonment.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> But, as I have had a good deal to do with this case, I
think I may as well remain in it to the end. So, with the consent
of the convict, the Counsel, and the Jury, I will go to prison myself.</p>

<p><i>The Entire Court.</i> As your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> Thank you all very much. I hope, after a month's
retirement, to have the pleasure of meeting you again.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 27.</i>&mdash;"Am thinking,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">Rigby</span>, just now, "of applying for Chiltern Hundreds.
Parliament isn't quite the place I pictured to myself when I fought
for a seat. Of course I've done pretty well. To be made <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>
right off, with <span class="sc">Waddy</span> around, and <span class="sc">Willis</span> still in prime
of life and energy, was a fine thing. But House seems perversely
inclined to accept me as a joke, and that's not the sort of thing I'm
accustomed to at Chancery Bar. Look what happened the other
night, when, in my learned brother <span class="sc">Russell's</span> absence, I answered
questions. Did it in my best, most imposing, and conclusive style.
Kept my eye on <span class="sc">Speaker</span> throughout, to see how he'd take it.
Effect most satisfactory. You know I make <span class="sc">Chitty</span> sit up, and
<span class="sc">North</span> tremble. They, to certain extent, used to it; all new to
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, and told accordingly. Was really fascinated myself.
I frowned at him, pursed my mouth, wrinkled my forehead, squared
my jaw, sometimes lowered my voice into my boots, anon uplifted it
above where my wig ought to have been. Being my first appearance
at table, thought it worth while to make an effort. Judging
from <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> limp appearance towards conclusion of my remarks,
felt I had done it. Suddenly curious noise, that I'm told is known as a
titter, interrupted me, and, before I had quite finished, there was a
boisterous roar of laughter."</p>


<p>"Oh, come," I said, "you mustn't take that too much to heart.
House will have its joke, and, if you won't make it, it sometimes
makes it round you, using you as lay-figure. Your voice and
manner in answering simple matter-of-fact question, were perhaps
a size or so too large. But you'll get the hang of the place by-and-by,
and will be all right."</p>


<p>"I don't think so," said <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>, sadly. "Look
again what happened just now. House unexpectedly goes into Committee.
Can't find <span class="sc">Mellor</span>. 'You take the Chair,' says the <span class="sc">Squire</span>;
'you'll fill it admirably.' No time for hesitation; I take the Chair;
Clerk claps Bill into my hand. I say, 'Question is, that I do report
progress, and ask leave to sit again.' Shouts of 'Aye,' and 'No.' 'I
think the Ayes have it,' I say, in deep chest-notes, with persuasive
fall of eyebrows. 'The Noes have it!' they shout. Very well; first
duty of Chairman is to be impartial; so <i>I</i> say, 'The Noes have it.'
Again they roar with laughter. <span class="sc">Woodall</span>, in charge of Bill, feels
for sword of Financial Secretary to War Office. Fortunately, can't
find it. Otherwise, Chair of Committees might have been
steepled with my gore. What shall I do next? 'Put question
again,' Clerk hoarsely whispered. 'Question is, that I do report
progress, and ask leave to sit again. Those who are of that opinion
say Aye; the contrary, No. I think the Ayes have it.' That would
at least get me out of the Chair, and you certainly won't find me
asking for leave to sit again. But what follows? In all parts of
the House, just now opposing progress, hilarious shout of 'No! No!'
rises up. That means I'm to go on with the Bill; but I know if I
declare 'the Noes have it,' they'll turn round to the 'Ayes.' So,
after standing for moment irresolutely, Bill in hand, I'm not ashamed
to say I bolted from table, taking Bill with me. House roared louder
than ever. Seem to have discovered excellent joke. But I don't see
it, <span class="sc">Toby</span>. If this is House of Commons life, give me the dignity and
quiet of the Chancery Bar."</p>

<p>Quite a procession of new Members took their seats on election.
Honours of the day with <span class="sc">Harry Lawson</span>, who, after stubborn fight,
has won Cirencester. As young <span class="sc">Harry</span>, with his beaver on, marched
to table, Liberals temporarily relieved themselves from imputation
that they don't know how to cheer.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Local Veto Bill brought in.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;"It's a natural temptation," said <span class="sc">Charles</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span><span class="sc">Russell</span>, "for the human mind to believe that Mr. G.'s latest performance
at table of House of Commons excels all he has done
before. There is a phrase&mdash;you are probably familiar with it in
<span class="sc">Horace</span>&mdash;which speaks of the <i>Laudator temporis acti</i>. But the other
impulse is certainly, in this connection, quite as strong, I, therefore,
hesitate to affirm that that's the best speech Mr. G. ever made; but
certainly it's among the best."</p>

Parliamentary Time.</h3></div>

<p>It was on Bimetallism. Like olives and claret, Bimetallism quite
an acquired taste; ordinary Member will have none of it; flees
House when subject announced. In the Parliamentary world,
Bimetallism supplies part of the <span class="sc">Browning</span> or <span class="sc">Ibsen</span> cult known
out-of-doors. Analogy accurate
inasmuch, that whilst mass of mankind
are averse to contemplation
of topic, the few faithful pass all
ordinary bounds in the enthusiasm
of their worship. Thus, for upwards
of hour to-night, <span class="sc">Meysey-Thompson</span>
handled it as if he loved it. <span class="sc">Montagu</span>,
whilst musically jingling in
trowser-pocket handful of newly-minted
sovereigns, equally adulatory.
Then Mr. G. walked in. It was
reasonably thought in advance that
Bimetallism would prove too much
even for the charm of his oratory.
Had evidently come down unprepared
for special effort; neither
sheaf of notes nor pomatum-pot. He
listened to mover and seconder, and
then just talked to entranced House,
crowding up in every corner. Quite surprised, as Mr. G. was himself
when he sat down, to find he'd been talking for an hour.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House declares by 229 votes against 148, will
have nothing to do with Bimetallism.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Hear a very pleasant thing in connection with an
old friend. Am told that as soon as Local Veto Bill passes into law,
<span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span> is to be raised to the Peerage.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asks <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>. "On the principle that
the Devil shouldn't have all the good tunes suitable for <span class="sc">Wesley's</span>
hymns, why should the Trade have the monopoly of the Peerage?
Why shouldn't there be a Viscount <span class="sc">Appolinaris</span> as well as a Baron
<span class="sc">Bass</span>, a Lord <span class="sc">Barleywater</span> to pair off with a Baron <span class="sc">Barleycorn</span>?
Let us drink (in toast-and-water), health and long life to Lord
<span class="sc">Barleywater</span> of Brayton!"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In discussion on Irish National Education Bill
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span> effects little surprise. Been running admirably in
double harness with Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>. This afternoon suddenly jibs;
nearly upsets coach.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Friday</i>, 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;"Begin to think, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, as
we walked home together in the moonlight, "that we shall scotch
this Home-Rule Bill yet. Expectation only just dawned on me.
When I went down to House in the afternoon, was of different
opinion. Had philosophically settled down to acceptance of inevitable.
Might maim it a bit in Committee; play with it so as to
block off other business, and send it up to Lords at so late period of
Session that they would seem justified in throwing it out, on score of
inadequate time to discuss it. Now I think we shall go one better.
<span class="sc">Courtney</span> thought he could serve Unionist cause better from standpoint
below Gangway. The supremest service he could render to
that cause was effected when he created vacancy in Chair."</p>

<p>"Don't you think," I said, "they were a little hard on <span class="sc">Mellor</span>?
Wasn't the sport something after the fashion of the gallant emprise
in Windsor Park with the carted stag? And then the merry sportsmen
didn't give the new Chairman the ordinary courtesy of a fair
start and a little run."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, "if you put it in that way, of course
there's something to be said. But all is fair in hate and war. Mr.
G. should have thought of that before he got rid of <span class="sc">Courtney</span>. Our
business is to stop Home-Rule Bill from passing, and after to-night
the way is clear, and the goal certain."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;New Chairman baited for an hour by Westminster
Clock. Before the lawless, disorderly squabble about Law and
Order in County Clare, regular foot-ball scrimmage, in which
<span class="sc">Saunderson</span> naturally turned up. In one of the pauses the Colonel
dropped into poetry? could hear him crooning to himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>There's Justice <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> of Clare,</p>

<p>And they've got no policemen to spare,</p>
<p class="i10">How quare!</p>
<p>They've got no policemen to spare.</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Seems, after all, <span class="sc">Mellor</span> quite right in his ruling
yesterday. Point was that, on supplementary Estimate, you may
not debate questions of policy settled when original vote agreed
to. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> denounced this as absolutely novel principle.
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> kept game up from other side, and for full hour
conviction borne in upon new Chairman that life not worth
living. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, appealed to to-day, declares <span class="sc">Mellor</span> to have
been in the right. Report of Select Committee on Estimates. Procedure
cited to show <span class="sc">Courtney</span> categorically laid down the principle
challenged, and systematically acted upon it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, reflectively stroking his chin,
"and <span class="sc">Courtney</span> might have got up and said so last night. Only
his fatal bashfulness, his irreclaimably retiring disposition, could
have kept him silent in such circumstances. True, his interposition
would have spoiled the little game of his friends. It would
not have been War, but it would have been Magnanimous."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
